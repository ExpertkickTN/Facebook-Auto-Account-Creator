# Facebook-Auto-Account-Creator

This small piece of code will create an account automatically by randomizing names. You need the **Selenium** library installed.

**Note:** This is an ongoing work. Beware that Facebook has security measures to prevent bot usage. 

**Important:** Do not forget to change the Web driver you use.
